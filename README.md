Scripts for IGMAS modelling

This repository contains scripts used for converting cavity model files into files IGMAS can use. They also include code for data interpretation from results obtained in IGMAS.

As of now, the files with the highest potential are in the folder 'Tube Modelling MatLab package'. It is advised to download this whole folder and try things out; there are already two Demo Files present with results to look into. Make sure to look into the documentation as well for further explanation of the scripts, variables that can be changed, tips for usage and potential problems.

If you want to use these scripts for creating IGMAS models yourself, this is perfectly possible. Make sure to change the directories accordingly.

These files are still in development mode. (Significant) changes and improvements will still occur, and notifying the owner of this repository of bugs happening with the scripts is greatly appreciated.

Enjoy!
